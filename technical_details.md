## Back-End

The website is going to use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), a cloud platform as service, and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as database. It will use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to build the application and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as the web framework. Express is a flexible and open source web app framework that helps in handling multiple and different HTTP request, supports multiple templating engines, and it is easy to use. MongoDB is part of the "MEAN" stack, like express, which facilitates their interaction, for example, mongoDB stores its data in JSON format, while express's http routing/managing has a great support for handling JSON middleware.

## Front-End

In its Front-End, the website will use [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) which is a JavaScript library for building user interface components. ReactJS will allow us to develop an application using a component-oriented architecture. In addition, the website will use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create a more responsive web application and the current version of Bootstrap require [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) which we will use to allow the website to have asynchronous calls to get data from the APIs we will use (SteamAPI, GOGAPI, and Epic Games API).

## Development Tools

The development of this website was done using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the main code editor. Visual Studio Code also allows for various extensions that gives us flexibility during development. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) was used to generate HTTP requests to test the backend during development. [Github](https://github.com/) was used for version control and code collaboration for this project.
