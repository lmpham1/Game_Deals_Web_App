## Project Idea(s) (to be replaced)

Develop a website related to grocery, games purchase, or warehouse. The website would allow for:

- Creation of accounts
- Products purchase
- Inventory management

A webapp/tool that lets users search for a digital game and compares the prices between digital storefronts to find the cheapest price. 
- Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG (3 biggest pc digital storefronts) have APIs we can utilize to fetch game data and price history. We will look into more storefronts to see if they have readily available APIs.
- Allow user account creation
- Allow users to wishlist games (saved to account) and when logged in users can access this page (or weâ€™ll have some UI element on the main page) to show current lowest prices for these games.
- Allow users to create email notifications to be notified if a game drops below a price
- Have a main search bar and some sort of filtering option for games/categories, etc. 
- (Optional) Create an ad area for revenue.
