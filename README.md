## Project Description

Our project aims to create a webapp that compares prices of digital games from different digital storefronts, stores users' game preferences, and sends notifications when there are promotions for their wishlisted or trending games.

### Searching for Games
Our main use case starts with users searching for a game on the webapp, then the webapp will display the results with their prices from different stores. Users will have the option to sort the games based on their prices, their rankings, or filter games from specific stores/categories. Users can click on a game to be redirected to the corresponding store. This use case does not require any authentication from the users. Searching for games will utilize the following APIs:
* SteamAPI:https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/home
* GOGAPI: https://gogapidocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
* Epic Games API: https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/services/en-US/

### Creating a Wishlist
The user can choose to create an account to wishlist their favorite games and get notifications when their prices drop. On each game’s information page there will be a button that allows users to add to their wishlist. Users will have access to a wishlist page that displays all their wishlisted games and prices.
=======
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
